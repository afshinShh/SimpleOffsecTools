## Acknowledgments

A significant portion of the tools in this repository were inspired by various blog posts found in this [thread](https://hacklido.com/lists/5) on Hacklido. The ideas and concepts presented in these posts served as a foundation upon which these tools were built and improved.

In addition to the aforementioned source, inspiration was also drawn from various other online resources and blogs. Due to the myriad of sources and continuous development, it is challenging to attribute each idea to its original source. Therefore, a collective acknowledgment is made here to all those unnamed developers and writers whose ideas have contributed to these tools.
