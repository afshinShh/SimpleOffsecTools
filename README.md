A significant portion of the tools in this repository were inspired by various blog posts found in [Hacklido](https://hacklido.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/). In addition to the aforementioned sources, inspiration was also drawn from various other online resources and blogs.
